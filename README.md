# Next.js Product Managment App

This project was initially developed with an Arabic user interface in mind (RTL). However, its core functionality built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS is easily translatable to support Left-to-Right (LTR) languages. We welcome contributions from the community to expand language support and features. If you're interested in contributing, please reach out! We'll be happy to add you to the contributors list.
